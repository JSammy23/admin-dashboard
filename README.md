Project Administrator Dashboard for the Odin Project

Styling features worth noting:
    The buttons in the article cards change color when hoverd, I also intent to write a script so after they are clicked they will be the same as the accent color.

    The sidebar links hover the accent color

    The header control buttons respond

I enjoyed playing with css grid and flexbox, I learned a lot about manipulating SVGs and using them as buttons.
